# New projects checklist 📋

When you start a new project in Dyne it's a moment of joy, for the people involved and for the project you start.

If you are the developer many of the time the purpose of the project, is for the joy of doing that! And dreaming about how your tech will enhance society and its users.

Here are some suggestions to make your project a Dyne.org project:

-   [ ] Ask people at Dyne.org for a review and note down opinions and criticism, do not take it personal 🦁 it will always be aimed at improving your project.
-   [ ] Make sure to acknowledge all people 👯  who have contributed to the project or whose work the project is based upon.
-   [ ] Add a licensing 📜 to the project (use AGPLv3). Assign the copyright to the __Dyne.org foundation__ and include your name, year and the short license statement **on every source code file**. Howto guide available on [/howto/licensing](/howto/licensing).
-   [ ] Book a demo at the weekly standup 📆 or at a internal tech alignment, start showing what your project does and why, then how. Take notes of feedback.
