# New projects checklist

When you start a new project in Dyne it's a moment of joy, for the people involved and for the project you start.

If you are the developer many of the time the purpose of the project, is for the joy of doing that! And dreaming about how your tech will enhance society and its users.

Here are some suggestions to make your project a Dyne.org project:

-   [ ] Ask people at Dyne.org for a review and note down opinions and criticism, do not take it personal 🦁 it will always be aimed at improving your project.
-   [ ] Make sure to acknowledge all people 👯  who have contributed to the project or whose work the project is based upon.
-   [ ] Add a LICENSE.txt file 📜 to the root of the project (use AGPLv3). Assign the copyright to the Dyne.org foundation and include your name, year and the short license statement **on every source code file**.
-   [ ] Book a demo at the weekly standup 📆 or at a internal tech alignment, start showing what your project does and why, then how. Take notes of feedback.
-   [ ] Announce the joy 🥳 in the public dyne chat channels
-   [ ] Document the essential subset of commands to install and run the software 📖 in the README. You can use this [README template](https://github.com/puria/readme)
-   [ ] Add more general documentation and the purpose and use-cases of the project ️🗺️ into a [Dyne.org website page](https://github.com/dyne/dyne.github.io/tree/main/src/pages/software) and file a PR asking for a review to the website curators.
-   [ ] Propose your logo 🖼️ or ask designers for help by giving some ideas about images and things that share inspiration with what your project do.
-   [ ] Make a promotional postcard ready for social distribution 📢 with [Luigi](https://luigi.dyne.org)
