# New projects checklist

When you start a new project in Dyne it's a moment of joy,
for the people involved and for the purpose of the project you start.

If you are the developer many of the times the purpose of the project,
is for the joy of doing that! And dreaming about how your tech will enhance
the society and its users.

Here some suggestions to boost it like just in Dyne.org we do.

- [ ] Start writing and coding alone or with your buddies till you feel happy enough to demo it at the standup
- [ ] Add a LICENSE and the copyright (mostly you want to use and AGPLv3-or-later)
- [ ] Document it with a essential subset of commands to run the software in the README.md and other standard info. You can copy from this [template](https://github.com/puria/readme)
- [ ] Add more general documentation and the rationale of the project in the site by adding a page [here](https://github.com/dyne/dyne.github.io/tree/main/src/pages/software) if you need help for the text and copywriting give a shout to the clusterdyne group
- [ ] Ask for a logo from the design people
- [ ] Ask for a social post card or make one by yourself with [luigi](https://luigi.dyne.org)
- [ ] Tweet it and ask the clusterdyne team to put it in the communication plan if it worths
- [ ] Ask for review from the collegues for insightful opinions and reviews
- [ ] Mention credits/aknowledgements explicitly if based on other persons work also
- [ ] If a service add the status of monitoring to the [monitoring page](https://github.com/dyne/status)
- [ ] Write in the public dyne chats announcing the joy
- [ ] Enable the Sponsorships in the settings of your repo
- [ ] Automate deployment if possible and suitable. Ask if need help and take inspiration from common and [shared workflows](https://github.com/dyne/workflows/tree/main/.github/workflows) like docker image publishing
