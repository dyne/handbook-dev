# Meet DYNE Dyne.org‘s Handbook-DEV

This site provides components and tools to help product teams work more
efficiently, and to make Dyne.org’s applications more cohesive.

# Introduction

We created Handbook-DEV to share the experience gathered previously by the
Dyne.org's hacker community. This handbook is open to everyone and will improve
over time... the aim is to share process and experiences and previous knowledge
that is curated in the Dyne.org's fashion with an open mind.
This handbook will try to organize the knowledge tree and share it to it's
public from a single source (this place).

## How to use

Every element in this handbook is a component or an article about how WE did
things usually sided with code and documentation.

We recommend that while building a new product you begin by following the
system as closely as possible, then you can adapt it to your personal needs,
and if you want to share, give feedback to improve the followed article.


## Who can use this handbook?

Handbook-DEV is open for anyone to use!
It was originally created to help guide digital collaboration tools used within
Dyne.org, but the system can be adapted to create citizen-focused services or
external digital products.
